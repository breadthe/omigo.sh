I've long wanted to share thoughts about development-related things but the hardest thing is to get started. Here I am though.

I've been a software developer (in some form or another) for most of my life, and if there's one certainty in this career it's the constant need for self-improvement.

I started Omigo.sh as a central platform from which I can showcase the personal projects that I am tinkering on in my spare time (yes, I have a developer day job as well), but also as a repository of coding knowledge that I have collected over time.

My intent is to use the Omigo.sh blog for recording techniques and solutions to problems that I have discovered while working with my favorite platforms, including (but not limited to) PHP, Laravel, Vue.js, TailwindCSS, Mac, PC, etc.

As much as possible, I would like to avoid duplicating content that lies a short Google search away, because after all, whenever I find myself in deep waters without an obvious solution, that's one of the first things I try. However, it's entirely possible that things will be repeated here at some point, but I can assure you it wasn't intentional.

Having said all that, and with reasonable certainty that probably no one will read this post anyway, I will now venture wherever the keyboard will lead me.
