I am moving the blog to a new site that will be a portfolio/resume hybrid. All the posts and articles on this site will transfer over the the new one, with appropriate redirects. 

I've changed my mind about the Omigo.sh organization concept Instead, I'll be blogging and operating under my own identity.

Because I am working on the new site, I haven't had time to post new content, even if it made sense.

In the meantime, if you read this, you might want to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/brbcoding) (yes it's new).
